# CVIP-Data-Science-Intern
This repository contains four projects that I have worked on, all of which involve machine learning and data analysis. The projects are:

IMDB Data Analysis
This project analyzes the IMDB dataset of movie ratings and reviews. I use Python and the Pandas library to explore the data, and I visualize the results using Matplotlib. 


House Price Prediction
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project that predicts the price of houses. The project uses the Kaggle house price prediction challenge dataset, which contains train dataset,test dataset,data_description,sample_submission file. Kaggle datasetlink:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which is a step-by-step process for data science projects.


Diabetes Prediction
This repository contains the code,data,plots and dataset for a machine learning project that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not. The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which is a publicly available dataset of medical records for Pima Indian women. The dataset includes 8 features that are known to be associated with diabetes, such as age, BMI, and glucose level. Pima Indians Diabetes Database:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.


Speech Emotion Recognition
This project recognizes the emotion of a person's speech. I use the Toronto emotional speech set (TESS), which contains audio recordings of people speaking different emotions. I build a machine learning model using the PyTorch library, and I evaluate the model's performance.

I hope you find these projects interesting. Please feel free to fork the repository and contribute your own code.
